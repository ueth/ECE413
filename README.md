# University Project Overview

This project consists of six assignments that cover various topics in computer security and networking. The assignments are written in C and are compiled with gcc (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0. 

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange and RSA Implementation

This assignment implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol and the RSA encryption algorithm. Detailed instructions are provided on how to run each part of the assignment, including the generation of public and private key pairs for RSA. 

### Assignment 2: Secure Server-Client Program using OpenSSL

The second assignment demonstrates the creation of a secure server-client program using OpenSSL. This includes the generation of an SSL certificate, compilation and running of both server and client programs, and the handling of network communication between server and client securely.

### Assignment 3: Enhanced Access Control Logging System

Assignment 3 develops an access control logging system, which allows for monitoring and logging of file access. The implementation includes malicious user tracking and usage statistics. It also includes instructions on how to update the logging file.

### Assignment 4: SQL Injection

This assignment explores the process of bypassing a login page using an SQL injection query, and retrieving sensitive information from a database by manipulating SQL queries in an insecure web application.

### Assignment 5: Network Traffic Monitoring

Assignment 5 involves network traffic monitoring using the Packet Capture library. This includes live network traffic monitoring, reading pcap files, and answering questions about TCP and UDP packet retransmission.

### Assignment 6: Network Scanning and Iptables

The final assignment involves network scanning and iptables, providing an adblock script with various functionality such as IP rule configuration, saving and loading rules, and resetting rules.

## How to Use

Each assignment has its own detailed instructions on how to compile and run the code, as well as answers to assignment-specific questions. Please refer to the READMEs of individual assignments for more information.

## Dependencies

The projects are written in C and some require specific libraries such as OpenSSL and the GMP library. You will need these installed to run the assignments. Also, the gcc version used is Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04.
